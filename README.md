## How to use this Volunteer Onboarding bot:

1 - To install this app on your repo, go to https://github.com/apps/volunteer-onboarding and click the green "Install" button. 

2 - You can choose to install it accross all your repos, or on selected ones.

3 - Open a new issue which will be your "Starter Issue". This must either be your repo's first issue, and/or have this title: "New volunteer? Start here!". __Be careful__ to copy and paste the title as it is written on this README. __Do not__ add extra spaces or characters.

4 - For your issue's body, feel free to use the example "Starter Issue" below.
Notes: 
  - Insert screenshots of your own repo where a screenshot is required in the walkthrough. This walkthrough is meant to be beginner-friendly, so it will be less confusing if your repository name shows on the screenshot. 
  - In step 2, you will need to edit the URL for the invite link by replacing {YOUR_USERNAME_OR_ORGANIZATION} and {YOUR_REPO_NAME} with the appropiate information.

5 - That's it! Your new volunteers now can go through the steps outlined in the Starter Issue and complete their automated onboarding.
